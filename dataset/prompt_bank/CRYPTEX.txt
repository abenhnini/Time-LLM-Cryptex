The Binance Bitcoin Hourly Candlesticks (BTC-H) dataset captures granular financial data from the Binance.us cryptocurrency exchange. It spans nearly four years, from September 2019 to July 2023, with hourly-level resolution. Each record contains second-to-second updates for key trading indicators: Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) prices and traded volume in USDT. Timestamps are stored in Unix time format. Inactive periods (with no trading activity) are represented with NaN values, while missing timestamps may reflect exchange/API downtime or data collection limitations. The dataset has been carefully deduplicated and validated, and is updated nightly to ensure consistency and completeness.
